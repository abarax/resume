###Matasano Crypto Challenges

The [Matasano Crypto Challenges!](http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/) are a set of increasingly difficult programming tasks that take challengers through the depths of implementing basic cryptography primitives and then through the various weaknesses and attacks against them.  This has been a fantastic learning experience and I am happy to share my code with those that are interested, although that takes out a lot of the fun in doing them. I implemented the first three sets in Python and then started again in Clojure.

Skills/Knowledge Gained:

- A deeper understanding of Python and Clojure programming.
- A much deeper understanding of Cryptographic primitives and algorithms.
- Knowledge of various weaknesses in cryptography systems and the attacks associated.


###Autonomous Robot
 
For a long time I have had a keen interest in robotics and hardware/software integration, so I embarked upon a goal of building an autonomous robot.
The goal was reached after a furious month of building, programming and learning.
 
Skills/Knowledge Gained:

- Arduino programming and hardware environment.
- C programming.
- Assembly Programming.
- Circuit building and diagrams.
- Soldering.
- Motors and Robotics.
- Hardware/Software integration and programming.
