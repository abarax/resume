Experience
---------------

###Safesite - www.safeonsite.net (Brisbane, QLD)###

Technical Co-Founder, 2013 - Present

- Django back end web development for main site.
- REST based API development for rich javascript client front end and mobile applications.
- Ember.js front end development.
- Amazon Web Services deployment and infrastructure management.

###Virgin Australia (Brisbane, QLD)###

Senior Software Developer, 2010 - Present

***Unify Project***

- I was the lead engineer on the new development of the 'Fare Search' web service. This is one of Virgin Australia's major sales channels and hence, a critical part of the business. It services millions of requests per day and required in depth technical architecting.
- Traveled to Dehli, India to ensure some key projects, that were outsourced, got over the line and met their deadlines. 
- Participated in the design and development of a connection manager proof-of-concept, using Java, Coherence and OSB, to facilitate the replacement of Virgin Australia's core reservation system. This would later become a fully fledged connection pooling manager and saved hundreds of thousands of dollars from being paid to external vendors.

***AIDX Project***

- I was part of a project team of two that designed and implemented a real-time flight event processing system. This system is responsible for consuming hundreds of thousands of flight event messages per hour. This system required reliable message delivery to the airport's 'Flight Information Display Screens' and hence was built using Java, clustered JMS queues, topics and EJB's deployed in a clustered Weblogic environment. 
- Wrote a message parsing system for legacy airline messaging standards using the Java parser generator ANTLR.
- Lead the design and implementation of user interface components using Java web services, Stripe and JQuery. This forged a new understanding of the operational support that projects should provide within Virgin Australia. This lead to a vast reduction in complexity of maintenance and testing of the system.
- Conducted numerous "white board" design presentations to interested stakeholders within Virgin Australia.

***Staff Travel Project***

- Designed and built an event driven employee processing service using BPEL, Advanced Queuing, Oracle Business Events and Oracle E-Business. This service created re-usable logic whenever employee information was added or updated in Oracle E-Business.
- Conducted presentations demonstrating this design to key stakeholders including the CIO.
- Development of re-usable Oracle OSB and Java web services.
- Introduced the use of SoapUI for automated web service testing and contributed to the design and build of the framework.


***General***

- Designed and implemented Virgin Australia's Oracle OSB automated testing and build management system using Python, Maven, Weblogic and SoapUI. This greatly increased development productivity and confidence.
- Participated in various technical discussions and took a lead role in dictating key decisions for Virgin's technical direction. Including the use of event driven principles, Enterprise Java Beans, automated OSB builds and web service testing.
- Conducted presentations and design discussions in development team meetings.


###Intelligent Pathways

Senior Software Developer, 2008 - Present

***Car Pooling Project - Project Lead (2 years)***

- Responsible for a team of two developers.
- Created work iterations for team members and project schedules/estimates using Atlassians bug tracking, issue tracking and project management software - JIRA.
- Test driven development in a JEE environment using Java, Spring, Hibernate, Cross Fire.
- Java Web service development using contract first designs.
- User interface development and design using Adobe Flex.
- Responsible for system design specification of new features and estimation of work.
- System administration in both Linux and Windows environments.
- Responsible for release scheduling and deployment of new versions into test and production environments.


###Customer Management Technologies

Software Developer, 2006 - 2008

- Worked on various government client sites implementing changes and new features in Java and PL/SQL.
- Development and maintenance of Java Web services.

Personal Projects
------------------

###Matasano Crypto Challenges

The [Matasano Crypto Challenges!](http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/) are a set of increasingly difficult programming tasks that take challengers through the depths of implementing basic cryptography primitives and then through the various weaknesses and attacks against them.  This has been a fantastic learning experience and I am happy to share my code with those that are interested, although that takes out a lot of the fun in doing them. I implemented the first three sets in Python and then started again in Clojure.

Skills/Knowledge Gained:

- A deeper understanding of Python and Clojure programming.
- A much deeper understanding of Cryptographic primitives and algorithms.
- Knowledge of various weaknesses in cryptography systems and the attacks associated.


###Autonomous Robot
 
For a long time I have had a keen interest in robotics and hardware/software integration, so I embarked upon a goal of building an autonomous robot.
The goal was reached after a furious month of building, programming and learning.
 
Skills/Knowledge Gained:

- Arduino programming and hardware environment.
- C programming.
- Assembly Programming.
- Circuit building and diagrams.
- Soldering.
- Motors and Robotics.
- Hardware/Software integration and programming.
