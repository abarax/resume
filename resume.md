Experience
---------------

*   **Virgin Australia** (Brisbane, QLD)

    Senior Software Developer, 2010 - Present

    - I was the lead on the new development of the 'Fare Search' web service. This is one of Virgin Australia's major sales channel's and hence, a critical part of the business. It services millions of requests per day and required an unending amount of performance investigation and architecting.
    -  Designed and developed complex distributed systems using Java which supported business processes relating to aircraft. These systems directly improved the 'On Time Performance' of the airline and saved a significant amount of both time and money for the business.
    - Java, EJB, OSB, Weblogic, ANTLR, Coherence, Spring

    ***Unify Project***

	- I was the lead on the new development of the 'Fare Search' web service. This is one of Virgin Australia's major sales channel's and hence, a critical part of the business. It services millions of requests per day and required an unending amount of performance investigation and architecting.
	- I was requested to go on a trip to Dehli, India to ensure some key projects, that were outsourced, got over the line and met their deadlines. Virgin had contracts with external vendors that were dependant on the work being done in these projects and hence it was critical that they were delivered on time.  Once the projects started to delay myself and one other team member were sent to rescue them.
	- Participated in the design and development of a connection manager proof-of-concept, using Oracle Coherence and OSB, to facilitate the replacement of Virgin Australia's core reservation system. This would later become a fully fledged connection pooling manager and saved thousands of dollars from being paid to external vendors.
    
	***AIDX Project***

	-I was part of a project team of two that designed and implemented a real-time flight event processing system. This system is responsible for consuming hundreds of thousands of flight event messages per hour, converting them to the industry standard AIDX. This system required reliable message delivery to the airport's 'Flight Information Display Screens' and hence was built using Java, clustered queues, topics and EJB's deployed in a clustered Weblogic environment. 
	- Wrote message parsing code of legacy airline messaging standards using the Java parser generator ANTLR.
	- Lead the design and implementation of user interface components, which forged a new understanding on the operational support that projects should provide within Virgin Australia. This lead to a vast reduction in complexity of maintenance and testing of the system.
	- Coordinated efforts between the Virgin and Sydney Airport teams to ensure successful delivery of the project to production.
	- Conducted numerous "whiteboard" design presentations to interested stakeholders within Virgin Australia.
	- Took part in critical meetings as a representative of Virgin Australia to external third parties including Brisbane Airport Corporation and Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd.
    
    ***Staff Travel Project***

	- Designed and built an event driven employee processing service using BPEL, Advanced Queuing, Oracle Business Events and Oracle E-Business. This service created re-usable logic whenever employee information was added or updated in Oracle E-Business.
	- Conducted presentations demonstrating this design to key business stakeholders including the CIO at the time.
	- Development of re-usable Oracle OSB web services.
	- Proposed the use of SoapUI for automated web service testing and contributed to the design and build of the framework.


	***General***

	- Designed and implemented Virgin Australia's Oracle OSB automated testing and build management system using Python, Maven, Weblogic and SoapUI. This greatly increased development productivity and confidence.
	- Participated in various technical discussions and took a lead role in dictating key decisions for Virgin's technical direction. Including the use of event driven principles, Enterprise Java Beans, automated OSB builds and web service testing.
	- Conducted presentations and design discussions in development team meetings .
	- Conducted design reviews, estimates and created proposals for continuous improvement.
	- Created SOA Developer workstation set-up guides as well as Oracle OSB, Weblogic and Eclipse installation guides.
	- Created an Oracle BPM workflow proof-of-concept for a catering project while working in the solutions team.
